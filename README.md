This project predicts yearly stock price percentage changes based on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores.

It uses machine learning models, including Random Forest and Linear Regression, to analyze the impact of ESG factors on stock performance.

The dataset combines financial price data with ESG ratings to create a predictive model.

Visualizations help explore relationships between ESG scores and stock price movements.

Designed for investors and analysts interested in sustainable finance and data-driven insights.# ESG-ML
